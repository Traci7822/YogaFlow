The Rails Portfolio Project is a lot more complex to build than previous projects have been. I believe that I made my project a bit more complex than it needed to be but the extra work and struggle to get it working as intended has taught me a lot in the ways of Rails. Before beginning anything, I sketched out a framework for the project which helped immensely in getting me started in the right direction. Everything about my code changed in some way but it was really nice to have a structured baseline and idea to work from. Keeping that focus and working towards my overall goals with each step was crucial to understanding my code and troubleshooting all the strange twists and turns I encountered. This project taught me to really take my time to understand all the components and how they work together before jumping in and creating.
